## Description
In this experiment, we explore the K-Means algorithm, a popular unsupervised machine learning method used for clustering. We implement the algorithm and discuss its applications and disadvantages.

## K-Means Algorithm Overview
K-Means is used to group data points into K distinct clusters based on their features, making it particularly useful for discovering patterns in unlabeled data.

### How It Works
1. **Initialization**: Randomly select K initial centroids from the dataset.
2. **Assign to Clusters**: For each data point, calculate the distance to all centroids and assign the point to the closest centroid.
3. **Update Centroids**: Recompute the centroid of each cluster as the mean of the points in that cluster.
4. **Iterate**: Repeat the process until the cluster assignments stabilize or a set number of iterations is reached.

### Advantages
- Simple and easy to implement
- Scalable for large datasets
- Fast and efficient
- Interpretable clustering results
- Flexible with different distance metrics

### Disadvantages
- Requires predefined K
- Sensitive to initialization and outliers
- Assumes equal-sized, spherical clusters
- Can get stuck in local optima

## Code Description

### Importing Libraries
We use the following libraries:
- `Numpy`: For calculations
- `Matplotlib`: For visualization
- `Sklearn`: To generate synthetic data samples

### K-Means Implementation
The K-Means algorithm is implemented in a custom class. Key methods include:
- `fit()`: Starts the clustering process.
- `forward()`: Calculates the Euclidean distance between data points and centroids.

### Error Calculation
Two functions are provided to calculate the mean error of the clusters:
1. `calculate_cluster_error()`: Computes the average distance of points from their cluster center.
2. `calculate_mean_error()`: Calculates the overall mean error across all clusters.

### Application: Image Compression
The K-Means algorithm is also applied to reduce the size of images. The process includes loading an image, converting it to a 2D array, applying K-Means, and visualizing the reduced-size image.

## Running the Code
To run the code, ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can use the following command to install any missing libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn opencv-python
```

### Example Usage
1. Generate synthetic data and visualize clustering.
2. Apply K-Means to compress an image:
   - Replace `'CI4_sample_picture.jpg'` with the path to your image file.

## Outputs
- Clustering visualizations
- Compressed images demonstrating K-Means application

## Limitations of K-Means
We also demonstrate the limitations of K-Means on various datasets, such as noisy circles.
